The current settings make it necessary for libip.a to be in the project's 
root directory. 
To achieve this, cd into the directory `ip' and issue the command

    make xcode

This will compile libip.a (`make all`) and copy it to the enclosing directory
(`cp libip.a ../`).

# Acknowledgements

The methods underlying the implementation of the image processing algorithms
in this project were taught in J. Weickert's course
"Image Processing and Computer Vision".
